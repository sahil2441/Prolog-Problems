%% listing all possible cases possible in 4*4 solution
%% Ive arrived at these cases using the contrain that:
%% T cant be odd.
%% Therefoer T can be 0,2,4. Threfore T(4) is true.
%% When T is 2, the only possible solution is L=1 and R=1.
%% Now when T=0, we make further cases by Solving for L and R by making 
%% cases out of number of S.

f(4,0,0,0).
f(2,0,1,1).
f(0,0,4,0).
f(0,0,2,2).
f(0,0,0,4).
f(0,1,1,2).
f(0,2,2,0).
f(0,2,0,2).
f(0,4,0,0).

test():-

r(R),
s(S),
l(L),
t(T),
(
	f(T,S,R,L)

	write("yes")
